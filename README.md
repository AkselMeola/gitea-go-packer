# gitea-go-packer

Go has specific requirements for its modules in zip format and not official cli tool exists. 
Go provides a module that can create such packages, but one must implement the command themselves. 

So after running my own bash script for a while I encountered some random issues and decided to partially vibe-code this critter and hopefully live happily ever after :)
